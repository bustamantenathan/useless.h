This header file contains a group of seemingly useless functions which one day may come in handy.

I made this header file and repo  to be used to test GUI's with out writing the code for some of the basic tests needed when making any type of GUI. Simply include this header file in you source code and type the name of which tests you would like to run
  ex:

        fizzbuzz();
        flip();
        hw();
        
etc..
